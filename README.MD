A **HUGE** thank you to the team at #mcdevs (Freenode IRC) and their [wiki](https://wiki.vg/Main_Page).
Without their work documenting the Minecraft codebase, this project wouldn't be possible.
Some comments from their wiki pages (particularly [protocol](https://wiki.vg/Protocol)) have been used 
throughout the codebase and all rights to those texts belong to their team.
